  abstract = {This paper surveys the recent attempts, both from the machine learning and operations research communities, at leveraging machine learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Given the hard nature of these problems, state-of-the-art algorithms rely on handcrafted heuristics for making decisions that are otherwise too expensive to compute or mathematically not well defined. Thus, machine learning looks like a natural candidate to make such decisions in a more principled and optimized way. We advocate for pushing further the integration of machine learning and combinatorial optimization and detail a methodology to do so. A main point of the paper is seeing generic optimization problems as data points and inquiring what is the relevant distribution of problems to use for learning on a given task.},

  abstract = {Piecewise-linear functions can approximate nonlinear and unknown functions for which only sample points are available. This paper presents a range of piecewise-linear models and algorithms to aid engineers to find an approximation that fits best their applications. The models include piecewise-linear functions with a fixed and maximum number of linear segments, lower and upper envelopes, strategies to ensure continuity, and a generalization of these models for stochastic functions whose data points are random variables. Derived from recursive formulations, the algorithms are applied to the approximation of the production function of gas-lifted oil wells.},
