\chapter{Deep Learning}\label{chap:deep-learning}

The advent of deep learning has revolutionized numerous fields, offering unprecedented capabilities in pattern recognition, decision-making, and problem-solving~\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.
In the realm of combinatorial optimization, particularly MILP, traditional methods often encounter computational bottlenecks when solving large-scale instances.
However, recent strides in deep learning have opened up exciting avenues for developing effective primal heuristics.
This chapter delves into the background of deep learning, focusing on the fundamental principles of supervised learning and neural network architectures.
The understanding of such concepts is essential for exploring the design and implementation of deep-learning-based solution prediction models tailored to MILP instances.
