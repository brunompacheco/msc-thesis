\chapter{Experiments}\label{chap:experiments}

- to address this dissertation's objective, experiments are carried to evaluate learning-based primal heuristics.
- The ONTS is used as a realistic application to benchmark the selected techniques
- this section presents the development necessary for the experiments, including model architecture, data acquisition, training, and experiment setup.

\section{Data}

Problem selected = ONTS problem

\subsection{Instance space: the FloripaSat I mission}

The instance space is defined based on the FloripaSat I mission
    plug info

Describe parameter space

\subsection{Data acquisition}

It is assumed that the instances that will be found in practice are uniformly distributed within the range defined by the parameters of FloripaSat I
Therefore U ~ I

As the history of instances solved is not available, we build our dataset...

\section{Deep Learning Model Architectures}

- GNNs are very promising, considered sota
- FCNs are not suitable for our problem, because it must suit instances with varying number of jobs (and, thus, varying number of variables), while FCNs have a fixed output dimension.
